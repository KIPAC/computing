notes and examples of how to compute at KIPAC

Purpose & Layout

This repo is for collecting documentation on
various KIPAC computing topics.

Each directory contains a `README.md` file with notes. The
files in each directory are examples. The directories themselves
serve as a table of contents.

This documentation will only get better if it
is maintained. Please fork this repo, add new documentation,
and then submit a pull request!
